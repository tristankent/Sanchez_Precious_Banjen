<p>This has been one of my favorite Kdrama because explores themes of love, loss, and redemption. It teaches us to appreciate the moments we share with others and to understand that death doesn't have to be the end of our connections with them.

<p>This movie is a romance novel that tells the story of a young couple facing challenges such as illness and time, I love it because it revolves around the idea of cherishing each moment and finding beauty in the midst of hardship, emphasizing the importance of love and resilience in the face of challenges.

      <p> I love listening to musics more on the sad genre ones. I feel like my additional love language is food! I love eating and it kinda serves as my stress reliever.

<p>As an empath, I feel deeply for others and want to succeed in life so I can help them. I believe success is not just about me but also about making a positive impact on others and amplifying my voice to raise awareness with compassion as my guide, I'm committed to using my talents to help people, whether through my academics, creativity, or personal growth. My goal is to create opportunities to assist and serve others, making a meaningful difference in their lives.
